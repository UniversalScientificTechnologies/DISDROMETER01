# DISTROMETER01
Mobile piezoelectric [distrometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disdrometer) used to distinguishing between rain, graupel, and hail during scientific thunderstorm observation.

The signal digitalization is based on high-precision [sdr-widget](https://wiki.mlab.cz/doku.php?id=cs:sdr-widget) technology, which allows sophisticated signal processing.
